# Kratom Tracker

Kratom Tracker is a Golang/React application designed to help my friend manage and track their Kratom doses for pain management purposes.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to assist my friend in maintaining a consistent and safe Kratom dosing schedule. It addresses the common issue of her forgetting when she last took her dose, which can be problematic as doses should be taken at least 2 hours apart.

## Features

Currently, the application offers two main features:

1. **Dose Registration**: A button that allows her to log when she's taken a dose.
2. **Daily Dose View**: A display showing all doses taken for the current day.

## Installation
There is a script called `build_prod.sh` that will build the application for AMD64 Linux. 
This script will create a `output` directory with the compiled Go binary with the React frontend embedded. 
You can then run the binary to start the application.


## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. When you take a dose of Kratom, click the "Register Dose" button.
3. View your dose history for the day in the Daily Dose View section.
